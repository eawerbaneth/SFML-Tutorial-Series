My name is Beth Werbaneth, and for the next couple of months I’m going to 
be working on developing a few simple games with SFML 1.6 (Simple and Fast 
Multimedia Library) and C++. The intent is to provide a few examples for 
people who are unsure of how to get started, and I feel that once one has 
the opportunity to see how a few things can be implemented, their own 
creativity can take it from there. I only started with SFML a few months 
ago myself, so this will be a bit of a learning process for me, as well. 
At any rate, I will be writing everything from scratch, and I will try to
 maintain this log fairly consistently, so if you find something that 
seems unclear, please refer to this document.
